<h2>Introduction</h2>
These functions were made to convert and manipulate kml and geojson files. The convertion process start by converting the file to a custom made format named "map" and then convert the map format to the desired output.<br><br>

This repo has 2 files. MapFunctions.ps1, which has all the functions to manipulate the data, and GUI.ps1, which is only a GUI to facilitate usage, including the option to load an excel file to add data to placemarks.<br><br>

<h2>How to use (GUI)</h2>
1 - Open powershell ISE and open both MapFunctions.ps1 and GUI.ps1 <br>
2 - Run MapFunctions.ps1 first <br>
3 - Run GUI.ps1<br><br>

The GUI has very limited options as it is still a work in progress. You can manually use the functions in MapFunctions in the meantime.
